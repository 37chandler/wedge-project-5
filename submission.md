<!-- Any general commentary you'd like to say about the project --> 

Please refer to the End of this document.

### Task 1

* Files for this task:


Task 1.ipynb has the python script for the process


`File1 Name`: 

table named "Clean" on GBQ has all the files uploded into it.
We can run queries on it for analysis.



### Task 2

* Files for this task: 

Task 2.ipynb has the python script for the process


`File1 Name`: 

query_results is the sample file created which could be used for analysis.

	

### Task 3

* Files for this task: 

Task 3.ipynb has the python script for the process.

`File1 Name`: 

a database file called reporting.db that has all the tables requested in task 3.

## Reflections

<!-- I'd love to get 100-200 words on your experience doing the Wedge Project --> 

On my first year of the course, in intro to stats, for the main project, we worked with data from the Department of Energy. I built a linear regression model that predicted if the Electricity bill will go up or down with the addition of an electronic device (depending upon the type of the electronic) to a certain type of household. For topics related to ANOVA, we used real world data from scientists that collected data in the woods to see what type of syrup flies/butterflies were most attracted to.

These topic made me want to learn more about the math behind the analysis because the reward i got from it was an understanding of the real world around me (Nature/People). The results from the analysis helped me decipher something about the world and i would even go as far as saying that the linear regression model i built could be used by the Dept. of Energy to manage power usage better. In other words, the analysis had an impact on the real world/people and not just a single business as the Dram shop or a Co-Op like the Wedge.

This project was dry and hard data engineering work. I would have had better motivation if it was something like i explained from Intro to stats.

But this project made me realize one very important philosophy. It's that, it doesn't matter if i get paid a lot, i don't want to do work for any private enterprise that is just trying to increase its own profits. Be it data engineering or building models (of which, i'd rather prefer the later), I'd rather take a low pay and do some work to destroy WMD or work on projects that makes living beings' lives better.
